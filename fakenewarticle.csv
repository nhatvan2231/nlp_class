Gross domestic product (GDP), the measure of all goods and services produced, rose at an annualized rate of 1.1 percent in the first quarter, federal officials estimated. That’s down from 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. Economists had forecasted the nation’s GDP to grow at an annualized rate of 2 percent in the first quarter.

","U.S. economic growth slowed dramatically in the first three months of 2023, according to data released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Gross domestic product (GDP), which strips out government effects, rose only 0.4 percent from a year ago, marking the fourth consecutive monthly contraction and the first contraction since July of 2012. The decline in GDP was driven largely by falling output from the oil and mining industries. While economic gains were driven overwhelmingly by higher-than-anticipated consumption, a decline in investment in fixed assets (including factories, equipment and other capital-intensive products), and declines in government spending offset some of the growth. ""While there is still room for growth in this recovery, the growth decline in this report was steep,"" said Michael Feroli of Barclays Capital.

“The Jerry Springer Show” ran from 1991 to 2018 and was known for its profanity-prone guests who often had to be restrained by on-set security guards as audience members wildly cheered, ""Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!""

I enjoy doing it. It’s a lot of fun.”

Walsh contends that it would make sense to set an academic threshold — say, the 25th percentile of applicants accepted over the past five years as determined through test scores and/or high school GPAs — and then admit students that clear the threshold at random, as opposed to the ostensibly meritocratic, anxiety-inducing process that purports to make fine distinctions between elite schools’ ever-increasing numbers of highly qualified applicants. It’s already the case that these admissions are not strictly meritocratic, as every elite college receives applications from far more qualified students than it can admit. So, Walsh contends, let’s have a lottery, and drop all the politically charged pretense.","In Vox on April 19, journalist and editor Bryan Walsh argues that elite college admissions should be conducted by a simple lottery system rather than by the inherently controversial assessment of merit. Walsh contends that it would make sense to set an academic threshold at a ""level that would permit the majority of students to remain intact."" Such an ""eliminating merit"" policy could serve as a model for public universities nationwide, where applicants typically do not have much in the way of academic achievements. According to this argument, the academic merit system of the public university system should be abandoned in favor of an ""eliminating all of the other criteria,"" such as GPA, ACT scores, and standardized test scores, because ""they are simply not that important.""

It assumes that college admissions standards are somehow ""un-level"" — that they can be completely eliminated because they are not useful or meaningful in determining college admissions.

After more than a year-long battle with the bombastic Florida governor, the entertainment behemoth filed a blistering lawsuit in federal court, not mincing words as it alleged that it had been the victim of a “targeted campaign of government retaliation” for having the gall to speak out against the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill.
“Disney regrets that it has come to this,” the company said in its lawsuit, arguing that it found itself in the “regrettable position” because it “expressed a viewpoint the governor and his allies did not like.” Disney added, “In America, the government cannot punish you for speaking your mind.""
The lawsuit, the culmination of ever-growing hostilities between the Magic Kingdom and Sunshine State, was filed moments after a DeSantis-appointed board moved to recover power it had lost over Disney’s special taxing district. Earlier this year, Disney quietly outmaneuvered the board and struck a decades-long deal to ensure it retained authority over the land around its sprawling Orlando-area theme parks.

This has allowed companies to move from a very small number of people holding lots of shares, which has allowed for many people to own big shares and start to sell a lot of different stock when demand finally comes and stock prices can rise. And the combination of increased earnings, the stock market and the growing share base means that more and more Americans are now taking control of their homes, houses, cars and the rest of the economic and financial system, rather than simply moving to another.
